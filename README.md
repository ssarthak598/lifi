# lifi
This is the code for Li-Fi that I made for space apps challenge at delhi. 

This project involves transfer of data using visible light. This project will help transfer data at high speeds from the earth to different places in outer space and remote areas using just laser light. It could be used in places where radio-communication is a problem such as aircrafts and rockets. With this technology, data can be transferred though laser beams across the remote desert and icey areas where lines could not be setup and we could also open research labs at those areas.
